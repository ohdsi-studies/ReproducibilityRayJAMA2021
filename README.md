Recently, a high-quality observational comparative cohort study conducted using a nation-wide sample of U.S. administrative claims was recently published in JAMA demonstrating a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events associated with treatment with rivaroxaban compared with apixaban. This study aims to independently replicate the original study according to its description in the recent publication and supplemental materials, using a similar database as was used in the original study. Additionally, we plan to evaluate the robustness of the study findings by conducting sensitivity analyses, assessing: 1) changes to definitions of exposure and outcome phenotypes, 2) calibration of effect estimates using empirical null distributions, and 3) observable study diagnostics that inform the validity of a given analysis. Finally, we plan to explore the generalizability of the findings by executing the analysis on several study databases that vary with respect to the populations they include (e.g. U.S. and non-U.S.) and their mechanisms of data capture (e.g. administrative claims, electronic health records data).
